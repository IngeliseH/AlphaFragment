# AlphaFragment: Protein Fragmentation and Pair Generation for AlphaFold and AlphaPulldown

## Overview
**AlphaFragment** is a Python package designed to streamline the process of preparing protein data for structural analysis using AlphaFold and AlphaPulldown. The package provides tools for importing protein data, identifying domains from AlphaFoldDB and UniProt data, fragmenting proteins without disrupting domain structures, and outputting data in a format ready for structure prediction.

## Features
- **Domain Compilation**: Identify protein domains from various sources including AlphaFoldDB predictions.
- **Protein Fragmentation**: Fragment proteins based on set lengths and overlap, ensuring domains are left intact.
- **Visualization**: Generate graphics illustrating protein domain locations and fragmentation results.
- **Output Preparation**: Produce output files compatible with AlphaFold and AlphaPulldown.
